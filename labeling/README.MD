To use the labeling program...
1. create a "images_tolabel" file in "labeling" file and put images in it
2. create a "images_mask" and keep it empty (it will save the images mask after you label)
3. create a "images" file and keep it empty (the labeled image would move to here)
4. excute the labeling.py
    - identify which type the court is
    - mark the point as the type do in order
    - click "q" on keyboard
    - type down its type number
    - if you want to skip the image, type down 5 instead of its type number
5. when you finish labeling all images, the program will stop
